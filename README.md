# Using a Wacom Tablet to Draw in Illustrator
by Autumn Scott

Wacom tablets have become a must have for professional illustrators. If you’re interested in building your skills as an illustrator, then learning to use a wacom tablet might be for you. Tablets are an exceptional tool for illustrators, they allow the artist to have more more control when creating sophisticated artwork, as well as create customized shortcuts to tools in applications. Many illustrators prefer tablets opposed to traditional media because of it’s natural “pencil and paper” feel. 

## Getting Started
Before we dive into drawing with the wacom tablet, there's a few things we need to get set up. First, close down all of your applications on your computer, connect the wacom tablet to your computer via the usb cable, then make sure you have the latest driver for your tablet downloaded onto your computer. 

To find the most recent driver go to this page:

Once you have downloaded the driver, it's time to get your wacom tablet preferences set up!

## Step One - Setting Up Preferences

You might notice that a Intuos Pro Wacom Tablet has a series of buttons running down the side of it. These are "Express Keys," and they will help you to work faster and have more control with yiur tablet. There are two ways to get access to these settings, usig apples system preferences, or going through the wacom desktop center. When first setting up the tablet I recommend using the wacom desktop center. It has more areas of control than just the settings. Later on, if you are looking to tweak or edit your wacom preferences I recomend quickly going through the apple menu.

### Two Ways to Set Up Preferences
1. Open launchpad, navigate to wacom desktop center
2. Go to the Apple Menu in the top left hand corner of the screen, go to system preferences, and then navigate to Wacom Tablet

If you went with the first way of getting to your tablet preferences you should have opened the wacom desktop center application that looks something like this.

## Your Wacom Desktop Center:

The Wacom Desktop Center allows you to access to changing preferences, backup settings, updates, the wacom marketplace, the store, and support fot the tablet. I think it's important to familiarize yourself with this center before using the tablet.

After you've got the desktop center open, click on the first tab at the top on the left "My Device." You should see to the right of that the name of your device. Mine says Intuos Pro M. Click on the name and then a list of your settings will pop up. Begin making your way through the list setting your own personal preferences to each control. Everyone's settings will look different from one another. It all depends on which applications your using and which hand is your dominate hand. The first section listed under the settings portion of the desktop center is "Orientation Settings." This is simply you telling your tablet which hand you'll be operating with. As you make your way down the list you'll come across the orientation settings, touch settings, pen settings, express key settings, touch ring settings, and the on-screen control settings. Once you've set up your settings it's time to get started in illustrator.

## Step Two - Setting Up Your Brushes In Illustrator

When you first get started in Illustrator you want to make sure that you have your tools set up correctly so that you get the most authentic tablet drawing experience possible. You want your paintbrushes to paint as if you were physically holding them, the more pressure the wider the stroke. So first, we are going to set up our brushes to paint with "pressure" rather than a "fixed" setting. 

To set up pressure settings with your paint brush go to the window menu, scroll down to brushes, open the dropdown menu in the top right hand corner of the panel, and then select brush options. Change all of the settings from fixed to pressure. Now you will have a more realistic painting experience when using your paintbrushes in illustrator. 

## Step Three - Getting Started In Illustrator

Now that we've got our brushes set up, it's time to start creating in Illustrator. Most illustrators create their artwork within layers. First, they will begin sketching their subject with the pencil tool. This will be on the bottom layer, while the finished more polished artwork will be on the top.
