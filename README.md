# Using a Wacom Tablet to Draw in Illustrator
by Autumn Scott

Wacom tablets have become a must have for professional illustrators. If you’re interested in building your skills as an illustrator, then learning to use a wacom tablet might be for you. Tablets are an exceptional tool for illustrators, they allow the artist to have more more control when creating sophisticated artwork, as well as create customized shortcuts to tools in applications. Many illustrators prefer tablets opposed to traditional media because of it’s natural “pencil and paper” feel. 

## Getting Started
Before we dive into drawing with the wacom tablet, there's a few things we need to get set up. First, close down all of your applications on your computer, connect the wacom tablet to your computer via the usb cable, then make sure you have the latest driver for your tablet downloaded onto your computer. 

To find the most recent driver go to this page:

Once you have downloaded the driver, it's time to get your wacom tablet preferences set up!

## Step One - Setting Up Preferences

You might notice that a Intuos Pro Wacom Tablet has a series of buttons running down the side of it. These are "Express Keys," and they will help you work faster and more efficiently. To begin setting up your Express Keys, open your wacom desktop center. 

Your Wacom Desktop Center should look like this:

After you've got the desktop center open, click on the first tab at the top on the left "My Device." You should see to the right of that the name of your device. Mine says Intuos Pro M. Click on the name and then a list of your settings will pop up. Begin making your way through the list setting your own personal preferences to each control. Everyone's settings will look different from one another. It all depends on which applications your using and which hand is your dominate hand. The first section listed under the settings portion of the desktop center is "Orientation Settings." This is simply you telling your tablet which hand you'll be operating with.
