# Using a Wacom Tablet to Draw in Illustrator
by Autumn Scott

Wacom tablets have become a must have for professional illustrators. If you’re interested in building your skills as an illustrator, then learning to use a wacom tablet might be for you. Tablets are an exceptional tool for illustrators, they allow the artist to have more more control when creating sophisticated artwork, as well as create customized shortcuts to tools in applications. Many illustrators prefer tablets opposed to traditional media because of it’s natural “pencil and paper” feel. 

## Getting Started
Before we dive into drawing with the wacom tablet, there's a few things we need to get set up. First, close down all of your applications on your computer, connect the wacom tablet to your computer via the usb cable, then make sure you have the latest driver for your tablet downloaded onto your computer. 

To find the most recent driver go to this page: https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers

Once you have downloaded the driver, it's time to get your wacom tablet preferences set up!

#Step One
Setting up preferences for your tablet allows you to work faster and to have more control over what you're doing. You might notice that a Intuos Pro Wacom Tablet has a series of buttons down the left hand side of it. These buttons are designed to make the tablet experience more customizable and efficient.
